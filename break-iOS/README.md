# break-iOS
The iOS port of break, written in Swift.

## Building
Building break requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which requires a ~5 GB download and many GB more for developer tools. You can get Xcode from the Mac App Store, [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), or Xcode-beta from Apple's developer website, [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) (Requires an Apple Developer account to download). Install any necessary tools as well. To install the app to your phone, you'll need a developer account from Apple as well, you can sign up for one at the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com).
